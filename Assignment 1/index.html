        <article>
            <h3>The Journey So Far</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Gyunom Dauda Maigida, and I am proud to identify as a Jaba by tribe from the southern parts of Kaduna State, Nigeria.
                My professional journey has taken an exciting turn as I transition from my established career as a lawyer into the dynamic field of technology, specifically cloud engineering.
                This shift is not merely a career change for me; it is a passionate pursuit fueled by my long-standing fascination with cloud technology and the myriad opportunities it presents.
            
            </p>
            <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                For as long as I can remember, I have been captivated by the potential of cloud computing. The concept of infrastructure abstraction resonates deeply with me,
                as I believe it represents the future of technology. This belief is grounded in the understanding that cloud solutions can streamline processes, enhance efficiency,
                and ultimately solve real-world problems that individuals and organizations face today. 
                My journey into technology has been driven by an insatiable curiosity to explore how software and systems can be harnessed to create impactful solutions.
            </p>
            <h3>Transitioning into Cloud Engineering</h3>
            <p>
                Transitioning to cloud engineering from law may seem unconventional, but I view it as an opportunity to leverage my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities in a new domain. 
                The tech industry is constantly evolving, and with the global cloud computing market projected to reach $1 trillion by 2026, the demand for skilled professionals in this field is skyrocketing3. 
                As businesses increasingly rely on cloud services for their operations, I am excited about the prospect of being part of this transformative landscape.
